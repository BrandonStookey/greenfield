## What is Rdr?
A simple, stream-lined application for keeping track of the books you have read and the books you want to read.

## Summary ##
At its core, Rdr offers an uncomplicated way for readers create lists of books.

Rdr is for the minimalist in all of us. Rdr is you and your books. That's it.
