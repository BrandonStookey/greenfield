## What is Rdr?
A simple, streamlined web app for keeping track of the books you have read and the books you want to read.

## Who needs Rdr?
For book lovers who want an easy-to-use app with the features they need instead of a thousand features they don't need.

## Summary ##
At its core, Rdr offers an uncomplicated way for readers to create lists of books. Rdr strives to present the user with right amount of features - the ability to keep track of how well you liked a book, the ability to find new books and the ability to keep track of a reading list - without adding needless features on top. Rdr is for the minimalist in all of us. Rdr is you and your books. That's it.

## The Problem ##
A service that keeps track of books you've read and want to read is not a new idea. In fact, one popular social network (*cough cough*) dominates the market. Unfortunately, the service which shall remain unnamed offers a bloated product with too many features. Additionally, said unnamed service sacrifices usability in order to offer a robust social network. But what if you didn't want a full-fledged social network and you only wanted to keep track of your books?

## The Solution ##
Rdr is the answer to all of life's problems. Okay. That may have been a bit of an oversell. Rdr maintains a core set of features with a focus on protecting a simplified user experience. We don't want to be a giant social network; we want to be the home for book lists. Sounds straightforward, uncomplicated, almost a little too easy? That's on purpose.

## How to Get Started ##
It's easy. Head over to [Rdr's Website](https://the-book-list.herokuapp.com/#/), login, and you're good to go. You can see other books on the main feed and add your own books on the profile.
